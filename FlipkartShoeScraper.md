The individual was frustrated with searching for large-sized shoes on Flipkart, so they developed a Python script to automate the process. The script utilizes web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup (bs4) and requests to extract information about specific-sized shoes from Flipkart. Upon finding the desired shoe, the script sends a notification through WhatsApp using the Twilio API. To ensure continuous monitoring, the script is scheduled to run every 2 hours with the help of the apscheduler library. Furthermore, the code is hosted on Heroku to enable it to run throughout the day.
